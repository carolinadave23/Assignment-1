1. How do assemblers and linkers work together?
  An assembler is a utility program that converts source code programs from assembly language into machine language.
  A linker is a utility program that combines individual files created by an assembler into a single executable program.

3. What is meant by a one to one relationship when comparing high level language to machine language?
  Assembly language has a one to one relationship with machine language, meaning that assembly language instruction corresponds
  to a single machine language instruction. High level languages, such as Python, C++, and Java, have a one to many relationship with
  assembly language and machine language. A single statement in C++, for example, expands into multiple assembly language or machine
  language instructions.

8. Do you suppose type checking on pointer variables is stronger (stricter) in assembly language or in C and C++?


12. Translate X=(Y*4)+3 to assembly language
      mov eax, Y  ;move Y to the EAX register
      add eax, 4  ;add 4 to the EAX register
      mov ebx, 3  ;move 3 to the EBX register
      imul ebx    ;multiply EAX by EBX
      mov X, eax  ;move EAX to X
